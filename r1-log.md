# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Sinead]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 18, Monday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Progress: Didn’t make as much progress as I wanted today.  Have never used GitHub before so before doing anything I had to read about it and download/install it on my laptop.  Started reading what it is and how it works.
Thoughts: Pretty annoyed I didn’t get started today but I will make up for it over the next couple of days.  Not realising there was a log already and having seen a few people blog about this challenge, I am thinking about making a blog myself.
### R1D2
Progress: Started going back over html from x years ago.  Not a lot has changed in terms of the basics so I got a small webpage done today.
Thoughts: I forgot how frustrating it is when you can't find that one little , or > stopping your whole page from displaying properly.  I perservered though because the feeling of getting it to work is such a good feeling.  Still haven't decided whether to blog so just leaving a page to my Notion notes for now.

### R1D3
Progress: Although slower than I would like, I have definitly made progress today.  The cat exerise web page looks basic, but it has most of the elements so I am happy enough.
Thoughts: Well, what can I say, even though I am refreshing stuff I learned a while ago (15 years or more!), it is still taking longer than I thought to go over it all again from the beginning.  I read for a couple of hours, then did a Free Code Camp exercise to create a web page, getting to the end and got stuck but it was 23:30 so I thought it would be best to look at it fresh again tomorrow.

### R1D4
Progress: I am so much happier today as I made progress and actually started coding css.  Things are definitely easy when you know how!  Finished earlier than other evenings too so that is good.  I actually had to stop myself as I was coding for nearly 3 hours - when you are in the flow and things are falling into place, it would be rude not to.
Thoughts: Checked Twitter first, went into a rabbit hole of Chrome Console Snippets, very interesting so I have added it to my list of “other” things to look into.  Today was a good day, I made progress as  I got the code from last night sorted and finished the exercise then moved on to the next exercise on freecodecamp.

### R1D5
Progress: Today I had other things on so there was no reading or other work, just 1hr and 15 minutes coding the freecodecamp exercises - finished one from yesterday and started a new one.  The new one introduced css a bit more including classes and rgb function which I quite enjoyed.  Again another good day!
Thoughts: I am really enjoying what I am learning now as it is a bit familiar, but I am also getting into new (to me) areas which is very exciting - does that make me some kind of “geek”?  Looking forward to whatever comes next.

### R1D6
Progress: I made good progress again today, just an hour took me to the end of the colored markers exercise on freecodecamp.org.  It is so amazing to see what you can do with some code and this is only the beginning.  Learned about hsl, hex and alpha channel/opacity and linear gradient.  Roll on tomorrow……
Thoughts: I am quite impressed with my result during this exercise, a couple of times I made silly mistakes, but I am learning every day and I love it!  So glad I decided to restart my journey to learn more, the more I learn, the more I want to know.

### r1D7
Progress: Today I planned to only code for an hour.  I started with a new exercise from freecodecamp.org (a registration form).  When I was just hitting the hour mark, I was stumped with the given instruction, of course, I couldn’t leave it till tomorrow.  So, I had to research a little bit but I got there, and in two hours (and 5 minutes, but who is counting?) I had finished the whole form.
Thoughts: So happy to have completed my first week.  I have refreshed what I already knew of html and stylesheets but have built on it so much already.  Looking foward to next week, although it has taken a lot of time to get adjusted to revision and learning, plus coding for an hour (at least) every day.  I am enjoying everything so far, only because I am winning (revision is easier than learning)!

### r1D8
Progress: Well after a whole week of refreshing my knowledge and learning some new skills, I was ready for a great week.  Instead of just focusing on what I had been doing, I went to a real life project.  I have been working on my sisters website, unfortunately, even though the progress I made over the last week was helpful overall, and the html I was putting into Wordpress was validated on a few websites, there was still an issue.  I spent over 2 hours working on it today but had to leave it as I wasn’t getting anywhere.  Hopefully, fresh eyes and focus next time will prove fruitful.
Thoughts: I’m pretty disappointed with how things went today.  I was very much looking forward to a second great week learning and coding.  However, I need to learn a bit more before going back to the project I worked on today.

### r1D9
Progress: Today was ok.  I was working on my real life project again today and actually got a page to look like a real webpage lol.  Slow going and frustrating because I don’t know everything yet, and wonder why it’s not so easy to just put that item in the place I want.
Thoughts: I have a lot to learn.  The html, css are ok, even the bigs of js I have been looking at along the way.  What gets me is all the extras included on webpages for fonts and webkit items.

### r1D10
Progress: Today, was a good day.  I left the real life project and came back to freecodecamp.  The exercise today was different as it was a list of user requirements rather than a step by step tutorial.  I started with a blank page and after only 30 minutes of coding from my own knowledge I had created a full survey form, with all the elements required, it passed all the tests, except two I knew weren’t going to pass.  I wanted to just write it all without looking at notes and was so impressed with myself.  Next the css to make it all look pretty, that took longer, I actually spent another 2.5 hours reading and coding, and it is not finished yet.
Thoughts: I’m happier today than the first two days this week.  I went back to the exercises on freecodecamp.org and was very pleased with my progress.  Only 30 minutes to code a form survey page from scatch.  I did spend another 2.5 hours on the css, reading and coding, but am so excited to be further ahead than I was only a week ago.  There’s is so much opportunity to use these skills and I’m looking forward to where this journey takes me.
