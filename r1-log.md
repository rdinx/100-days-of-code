# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Sinead]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 18, Monday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Progress: Didn’t make as much progress as I wanted today.  Have never used GitHub before so before doing anything I had to read about it and download/install it on my laptop.  Started reading what it is and how it works.
Thoughts: Pretty annoyed I didn’t get started today but I will make up for it over the next couple of days.  Not realising there was a log already and having seen a few people blog about this challenge, I am thinking about making a blog myself.
### R1D2
Progress: Started going back over html from x years ago.  Not a lot has changed in terms of the basics so I got a small webpage done today.
Thoughts: I forgot how frustrating it is when you can't find that one little , or > stopping your whole page from displaying properly.  I perservered though because the feeling of getting it to work is such a good feeling.  Still haven't decided whether to blog so just leaving a page to my Notion notes for now.

### R1D3
Progress: Although slower than I would like, I have definitly made progress today.  The cat exerise web page looks basic, but it has most of the elements so I am happy enough.
Thoughts: Well, what can I say, even though I am refreshing stuff I learned a while ago (15 years or more!), it is still taking longer than I thought to go over it all again from the beginning.  I read for a couple of hours, then did a Free Code Camp exercise to create a web page, getting to the end and got stuck but it was 23:30 so I thought it would be best to look at it fresh again tomorrow.

### R1D4
Progress: I am so much happier today as I made progress and actually started coding css.  Things are definitely easy when you know how!  Finished earlier than other evenings too so that is good.  I actually had to stop myself as I was coding for nearly 3 hours - when you are in the flow and things are falling into place, it would be rude not to.
Thoughts: Checked Twitter first, went into a rabbit hole of Chrome Console Snippets, very interesting so I have added it to my list of “other” things to look into.  Today was a good day, I made progress as  I got the code from last night sorted and finished the exercise then moved on to the next exercise on freecodecamp.

### R1D5
Progress: Today I had other things on so there was no reading or other work, just 1hr and 15 minutes coding the freecodecamp exercises - finished one from yesterday and started a new one.  The new one introduced css a bit more including classes and rgb function which I quite enjoyed.  Again another good day!
Thoughts: I am really enjoying what I am learning now as it is a bit familiar, but I am also getting into new (to me) areas which is very exciting - does that make me some kind of “geek”?  Looking forward to whatever comes next.

### R1D6
Progress: I made good progress again today, just an hour took me to the end of the colored markers exercise on freecodecamp.org.  It is so amazing to see what you can do with some code and this is only the beginning.  Learned about hsl, hex and alpha channel/opacity and linear gradient.  Roll on tomorrow……
Thoughts: I am quite impressed with my result during this exercise, a couple of times I made silly mistakes, but I am learning every day and I love it!  So glad I decided to restart my journey to learn more, the more I learn, the more I want to know.

### r1D7
Progress: Today I planned to only code for an hour.  I started with a new exercise from freecodecamp.org (a registration form).  When I was just hitting the hour mark, I was stumped with the given instruction, of course, I couldn’t leave it till tomorrow.  So, I had to research a little bit but I got there, and in two hours (and 5 minutes, but who is counting?) I had finished the whole form.
Thoughts: So happy to have completed my first week.  I have refreshed what I already knew of html and stylesheets but have built on it so much already.  Looking foward to next week, although it has taken a lot of time to get adjusted to revision and learning, plus coding for an hour (at least) every day.  I am enjoying everything so far, only because I am winning (revision is easier than learning)!

### r1D8
Progress: Well after a whole week of refreshing my knowledge and learning some new skills, I was ready for a great week.  Instead of just focusing on what I had been doing, I went to a real life project.  I have been working on my sisters website, unfortunately, even though the progress I made over the last week was helpful overall, and the html I was putting into Wordpress was validated on a few websites, there was still an issue.  I spent over 2 hours working on it today but had to leave it as I wasn’t getting anywhere.  Hopefully, fresh eyes and focus next time will prove fruitful.
Thoughts: I’m pretty disappointed with how things went today.  I was very much looking forward to a second great week learning and coding.  However, I need to learn a bit more before going back to the project I worked on today.

### r1D9
Progress: Today was ok.  I was working on my real life project again today and actually got a page to look like a real webpage lol.  Slow going and frustrating because I don’t know everything yet, and wonder why it’s not so easy to just put that item in the place I want.
Thoughts: I have a lot to learn.  The html, css are ok, even the bigs of js I have been looking at along the way.  What gets me is all the extras included on webpages for fonts and webkit items.

### r1D10
Progress: Today, was a good day.  I left the real life project and came back to freecodecamp.  The exercise today was different as it was a list of user requirements rather than a step by step tutorial.  I started with a blank page and after only 30 minutes of coding from my own knowledge I had created a full survey form, with all the elements required, it passed all the tests, except two I knew weren’t going to pass.  I wanted to just write it all without looking at notes and was so impressed with myself.  Next the css to make it all look pretty, that took longer, I actually spent another 2.5 hours reading and coding, and it is not finished yet.
Thoughts: I’m happier today than the first two days this week.  I went back to the exercises on freecodecamp.org and was very pleased with my progress.  Only 30 minutes to code a form survey page from scatch.  I did spend another 2.5 hours on the css, reading and coding, but am so excited to be further ahead than I was only a week ago.  There’s is so much opportunity to use these skills and I’m looking forward to where this journey takes me.

### r1D11
Progress: I finished the survey form exercise, played around with css to make the form look better.  I liked the idea of a gradient background so I went with that, which meant I needed to make the input boxes transparent, so I now know about opacity.  I think it turned out ok, progress is progress.  I’m hoping next time I make a survey form it will be much better and more in keeping with today’s styles.
Thoughts: I’m happy to have finished the exercise today.  I did need to refer to notes and Google a few times.  I could have spent hours/days even trying to make it better, however, I want to learn more and think moving on would be a better use of my time.

### r1D12
Progress: Lots of progress today.  Started a new exercise, finished it quickly, then started and finished another two on freecodecamp.org.  Learning new things now, css boxes (filter, blur and transform), css flex (flex-object, flex-direction, object-fit) along with dividers, indent and span, a lot for one day but I’m enjoying it so much.  I ended up coding for 2 hours and 50 minutes as I wanted to finish the exercises so I could start fresh again tomorrow.
Thoughts: Overall, I’m really impressed with what can be achieved with a little bit of code, as well as my own knowledge and being able to build on it, so far so good.  My head is spinning with ideas of things I could do and would like to do, but I’m going to keep on track and just keep focusing on this consistent daily learning approach.

### r1D13
Progress: Not a lot of progress today, sore head and lack of sleep don’t make for good learning environment!  I did do about an hour and a half (because I was googling a few items, and I wanted to finish one section).  I did come across new things today like screen reader css and making web more accessible with roles and aria-labelledby.
Thoughts: Not feeling the best today, sore head, however I did commit to 100 days and I have been enjoying everything so far and don’t want to give up.  I am doing this for myself so I need to do the best I can.

### r1D14
Progress: Made good progress today, mainly css, as I made use of pseudo elements and targeting nested elements.  I was hoping to finish this exercise, but having done 1 hour and 20 minutes, the questions were still appearing so I just left it at this point.
Thoughts: Can’t believe I am two weeks in already.  The time has flown and I have enjoyed every minute so far.  I have learned so much and build on my existing knowledge, even though it was so long ago (15 years or more), it is all very relevant as html and css are still making the web.

### r1D15
Progress: Only worked for an hour today, however, didn’t get much done as I was too sore to concentrate.
Thoughts: This is exactly why I haven’t or wouldn’t want to work for someone else, I don’t want to let anyone down.

### r1D16
Progress: Worked on accessibility quiz, ended up reading and re-reading about selectors, in the end it was <select> I was looking for.  Anyway, I got the exercise finished which feels good.
Thoughts: Glad I was able to get something done today.

### r1D17
Progress: No progress at all today.  I was ill.
Thoughts: None, too ill to think about anything today.

### r1D18
Progress: Quite happy with this page.  Freecodecamp.org again today, had to create a tribute page with certain basic elements and styles.  Finished it in an hour so very pleased with that.
Thoughts: Glad to be back to it today.  I’m going to try another hour later to make up for yesterday though.

### r1D19
Progress: I did well today.  Started a new exercise on freecodecamp.org and finished it in 2 hours (to make up for the hour I missed yesterday).  It was a good exercise in that I was going over tables, which I had covered before, but the css and using pseudo classes etc was new so good to get the whole exercise done in one sitting.  I enjoyed watching all the elements move on the preview while writing the code.
Thoughts: Very happy I got some work done today.  I am happy with today’s exercise as it was reinforcing what I previously knew and recently learned.  Happy to be back on track.

### r1D20
Progress: I made good progress today, two very different projects on freecodecamp.org.  Rather than focusing on text and graphics, it was more about shapes and positioning.  I learned about z-index and incorporating font icons.
Thoughts: Really enjoyed these exercises, they were totally different but very effective at getting the idea across.

### r1D21
Progress: Worked on something a bit different today.  Watched a five day series on html and css essentials on YouTube and created (the beginning of) a portfolio.  I enjoyed watching someone just thinking and typing without a plan.  I aspire to be like that!
Thoughts: Thinking about what I should work on next week.  I have been doing well for these first 3 weeks using freecodecamp.org exercises every day, however, I don’t know whether to finish out 4 weeks on it then move on or move on now.

### r1D22
Progress: Slow progress today.  Started a new freecodecamp.org exercise, creating technical documentation page, with side navbar.  First time I have tried a side navigation, so it was interesting to see how it built up.
Thoughts: I decided to give another week to html and css before moving on to a bit of JS.

### r1D23
Progress: Really enjoyed this freecodecamp.org exercise today.  It is the first time I’ve used variables in css and this exericse was a great way to understand and see visually what happens with subtle changes.  Loving it - one of my favourite projects so far.
Thoughts: It i[s fascinating to me what can be achieved with just text.  This exercise focused on creating coloured shapes and introduced using variables to change colours at a certain screen size.  I’m really looking forward to what else I will learn on this journey.

### r1D24
Progress: Slow progress today, just because there are a lot of tags and I am typing every single tag to ensure I know what I am doing before relying on an editor to assist and speed coding up.
Thoughts: Glad to be back to web page today, not impressed by the design of this one but it includes blockquotes and grid column layout so that is different.  Still enjoying it all though.

### r1D25
Progress: Finished the magazine exercise I had started yesterday, took longer than an hour but I wanted to finish it today as I don't like to stay on the same exercise for too long, I want to keep moving on with new things I liked creating this layout, making use of the flexbox and columns and making it responsive with a number of media queries.
Thoughts: Just moving along, looking forward to a change from next week.
