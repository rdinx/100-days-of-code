# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Sinead]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 18, Monday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Progress: Didn’t make as much progress as I wanted today.  Have never used GitHub before so before doing anything I had to read about it and download/install it on my laptop.  Started reading what it is and how it works.
Thoughts: Pretty annoyed I didn’t get started today but I will make up for it over the next couple of days.  Not realising there was a log already and having seen a few people blog about this challenge, I am thinking about making a blog myself.
### R1D2
Progress: Started going back over html from x years ago.  Not a lot has changed in terms of the basics so I got a small webpage done today.
Thoughts: I forgot how frustrating it is when you can't find that one little , or > stopping your whole page from displaying properly.  I perservered though because the feeling of getting it to work is such a good feeling.  Still haven't decided whether to blog so just leaving a page to my Notion notes for now.

### R1D3
Progress: Although slower than I would like, I have definitly made progress today.  The cat exerise web page looks basic, but it has most of the elements so I am happy enough.
Thoughts: Well, what can I say, even though I am refreshing stuff I learned a while ago (15 years or more!), it is still taking longer than I thought to go over it all again from the beginning.  I read for a couple of hours, then did a Free Code Camp exercise to create a web page, getting to the end and got stuck but it was 23:30 so I thought it would be best to look at it fresh again tomorrow.

### R1D4
Progress: I am so much happier today as I made progress and actually started coding css.  Things are definitely easy when you know how!  Finished earlier than other evenings too so that is good.  I actually had to stop myself as I was coding for nearly 3 hours - when you are in the flow and things are falling into place, it would be rude not to.
Thoughts: Checked Twitter first, went into a rabbit hole of Chrome Console Snippets, very interesting so I have added it to my list of “other” things to look into.  Today was a good day, I made progress as  I got the code from last night sorted and finished the exercise then moved on to the next exercise on freecodecamp.

### R1D5
Progress: Today I had other things on so there was no reading or other work, just 1hr and 15 minutes coding the freecodecamp exercises - finished one from yesterday and started a new one.  The new one introduced css a bit more including classes and rgb function which I quite enjoyed.  Again another good day!
Thoughts: I am really enjoying what I am learning now as it is a bit familiar, but I am also getting into new (to me) areas which is very exciting - does that make me some kind of “geek”?  Looking forward to whatever comes next.
