# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Sinead]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 18, Monday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Progress: Didn’t make as much progress as I wanted today.  Have never used GitHub before so before doing anything I had to read about it and download/install it on my laptop.  Started reading what it is and how it works.
Thoughts: Pretty annoyed I didn’t get started today but I will make up for it over the next couple of days.  Not realising there was a log already and having seen a few people blog about this challenge, I am thinking about making a blog myself.
### R1D2
Progress: Started going back over html from x years ago.  Not a lot has changed in terms of the basics so I got a small webpage done today.
Thoughts: I forgot how frustrating it is when you can't find that one little , or > stopping your whole page from displaying properly.  I perservered though because the feeling of getting it to work is such a good feeling.  Still haven't decided whether to blog so just leaving a page to my Notion notes for now.
